# Breast-Cancer-Project
Breast Cancer Diagnosis Dataset

Description

This dataset contains medical records related to breast cancer diagnosis. Each row represents a tumor sample, with multiple features describing cell nucleus characteristics extracted from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses. 
Data Columns

id: Unique identifier for each sample

radius_mean, texture_mean, perimeter_mean, area_mean, smoothness_mean: Various measurements of the cell nuclei

compactness_mean, concavity_mean, concave points_mean, symmetry_mean, fractal_dimension_mean: Additional shape-related features

..._worst: Worst (largest) values for each feature across all cell nuclei in the sample

Unnamed: 32: An empty column (possibly unnecessary)

Usage

To load this dataset in Python using pandas:

import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Display first few rows
print(df.head())

License

Ensure that you have the appropriate permissions to use and distribute this dataset. The dataset should be used for research, analysis, and educational purposes only.

Contribution

Feel free to contribute by improving the dataset, adding more insights, or creating visualizations to better understand the data.

Here are the steps to use this dataset effectively:

1. Download and Prepare the Dataset
Ensure you have the data.csv file in your project directory.
If needed, rename or clean the dataset.
2. Install Required Libraries
Make sure you have Python and Pandas installed. If not, install Pandas using:


pip install pandas
3. Load the Dataset in Python
Use Pandas to read the CSV file:


import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Display the first few rows
print(df.head())
4. Understand the Dataset
Check the column names and data types:


print(df.info())
Check for missing values:


print(df.isnull().sum())
5. Clean the Data (If Necessary)
Drop unnecessary columns (like Unnamed: 32 which seems empty):



df = df.drop(columns=['Unnamed: 32'])


df = df.dropna()  # Removes rows with missing values
6. Data Analysis
Get basic statistics:


print(df.describe())
Count occurrences of diagnosis values:


print(df['diagnosis'].value_counts())
7. Data Visualization (Optional)
Install Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization:


pip install matplotlib seaborn
Plot a distribution of diagnoses:


import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

sns.countplot(x='diagnosis', data=df)
plt.show()
8. Save and Upload the Dataset
Ensure your dataset is clean.
